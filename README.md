## 🔍 Overview

Hack This Out is a comprehensive cybersecurity training platform that provides hands-on experience with penetration testing and ethical hacking. The platform allows users to practice their cybersecurity skills on virtual machines hosted in the cloud, participate in time-limited contests, and track their progress as they develop their skills.

## ✨ Features

### 👨‍💻 For Users
- **🖥️ Virtual Machine Access**: Launch and interact with vulnerable machines hosted on AWS EC2
- **🔒 VPN Connection**: Secure access to practice environments via OpenVPN
- **📈 Skill Progression**: Earn experience points (EXP) by solving challenges and level up
- **💡 Hint System**: Get help when stuck with a progressive hint system
- **🏆 Contests**: Participate in time-limited hacking competitions
- **🏅 Leaderboards**: Compare your skills with other users

### 👨‍🔧 For Administrators
- **⚙️ Machine Management**: Create, update, and manage vulnerable machine templates
- **📅 Contest Creation**: Set up and schedule hacking competitions
- **👥 User Management**: Monitor user progress and manage permissions

- **📉 Analytics**: View platform usage statistics and user performance

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express** framework
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for data storage
- **JWT** for authentication
- **AWS SDK** for EC2 instance management and S3 storage
- **bcrypt** for password hashing
- **node-cron** for scheduled tasks

### Frontend
- **React** with **TypeScript**
- **Material UI** for component styling
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Axios** for API requests
- **i18next** for internationalization
- **SCSS** for custom styling

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

1. **Frontend**: React-based SPA that communicates with the backend API
2. **Backend API**: Express server that handles business logic and database operations
3. **AWS Integration**: Manages EC2 instances for vulnerable machines
4. **MongoDB Database**: Stores user data, machine templates, and contest information

## 🔐 Security Features

- Secure authentication with JWT tokens
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS protection
- HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- Secure VPN access to vulnerable machines
